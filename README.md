 Chinese Checkers bot in Python

## How To Build and Install the Package Locally

1. **Build:**
   - Open a terminal/command prompt.
   - Navigate (cd) to the ChineseCheckersBot directory.
   - Run the following command to build your package:
    ```bash
    python setup.py sdist
    ```
    This creates a source distribution of the package in a dist directory.


2. **Install Locally:**
  - You can install the package locally (for your user) with pip:

     ```bash
    pip install .
     ```

    Or install it for development (changes to the source files immediately affect the installed package without needing a reinstall):

    ```bash
    pip install -e . 
    ```
